# Enhanced UI Features - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED:

### 1. Test Notification API Endpoint
**Location:** `main.py` - Line ~2002

**Function:** Sends a test notification through all configured Apprise URLs

## üöÄ READY TO IMPLEMENT:

Due to the large size of the UI enhancements (adding ~1500+ lines of HTML/CSS/JavaScript), I recommend implementing them in stages OR creating them as a comprehensive single update.

### Implementation Options:

#### Option A: Single Comprehensive Update (Recommended)
- Replace the entire `home()` function with enhanced version
- All 8 features work together seamlessly
- Professional, polished interface
- ~1500 lines of well-organized HTML/CSS/JS

#### Option B: Staged Implementation
- Implement features 1-2 at a time
- Incremental testing
- Takes longer but more controlled

The enhanced home() function will include:

```
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def home():
    # Metrics data
    stats = _metrics.get_stats()
    success_rate = calculate_success_rate(stats)
