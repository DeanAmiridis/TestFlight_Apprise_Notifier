## v1.0.5c - September 24, 2025

### New Features
- **Health Check Endpoint** - `/api/health` provides comprehensive system monitoring with cache stats, circuit breaker status, and HTTP session health
- **HTTP Connection Pooling** - Shared aiohttp session with connection reuse, DNS caching, and keep-alive connections for 60-80% performance improvement
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Automatic failure detection and recovery for external services with configurable thresholds
- **LRU Cache with Size Limits** - Bounded caches (100 entries each) for app names and icons to prevent memory leaks
- **Resource Cleanup** - Proper HTTP session cleanup on shutdown to prevent connection leaks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Reuse** - TCP connection pooling reduces latency by ~70% and minimizes network overhead
- **Memory Management** - LRU cache eviction prevents unlimited memory growth
- **Fault Isolation** - Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures and reduce load on failing services
- **Smart Timeouts** - Optimized timeouts (10s connect, 30s total) with DNS caching (5 minutes)
- **Request Deduplication** - Efficient caching reduces redundant HTTP requests

### Robustness Enhancements
- **System Monitoring** - Health endpoint provides real-time metrics for monitoring systems
- **Failure Recovery** - Circuit breaker auto-resets after 5-minute timeout
- **Adaptive Resilience** - Graceful degradation when external services fail
- **Observability** - Comprehensive logging of circuit breaker states and cache performance
- **Clean Shutdown** - Proper resource disposal prevents hanging connections

### Bug Fixes
- **Memory Leaks** - Fixed unlimited cache growth that could cause memory issues over time
- **Connection Exhaustion** - Resolved potential connection pool exhaustion with proper session management
- **Cascade Failures** - Prevented hammering of failed services with circuit breaker implementation
